## Task definition ##

Implement the method [RemoveDuplicateWords](https://gitlab.com/autocode-tasks/remove-duplicate-words/-/blob/master/RemoveDuplicateWordsTask/WordsManipulation.cs#L16) that removes all duplicate words from string, leaving only single (first) words entries.
Case sensetivity of finding duplicates depends on the `caseSensetive` argument. By word we shall mean the unit that consists only of latin alphabet characters and numbers. All other characters should be considered delimiters between words.
